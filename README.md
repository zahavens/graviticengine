Brainstorm Notes, Math, and Drawings for the Gravitic Engine concept.

This repository contains resources for a theoretical device, currently called Gravitic Engine 7.

The hope is that one day, 
-when nuclear fusion fails to deliver on its promises, (especially within the time tables given by CEOs of nuclear fusion companies),
-when solar panels fail to provide adequate power outside of noon,
-when battery technology is recognized as a patch, not a long-term solution,
-when natural gas burning is seen as a stepping stone, not a final solution,

there will be a serious re-evaluation of any and all power sources concerned sentients can think of.
Funding for prototype testing for new designs will help the energy goals of all.
The road to a fully functional prototype can be long.

All of humanity (and even AI, AGI, ASI, etc.) will need electrical power.
This is a strong reason to work together for a literally brighter future.

The project details independent research on a potential alternative method to generate electricity.
A long-term goal is for the dimensions detailed in the spreadsheet can be drawn and simulated in CAD,
to help independently verify the math result, using the same dimensions, and build enough confidence in the research to justify a future prototyping phase.
