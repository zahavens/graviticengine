Brainstorm Notes, Math, and Drawings for the Gravitic Engine concept.

This repository contains resources on a theoretical device, currently called Gravitic Engine 7.

The hope is that one day, 
-when nuclear fusion fails to deliver on its promises, (especially within the time tables given by CEOs of nuclear fusion companies),
-when solar panels fail to provide adequate power outside of noon,
-when battery technology is recognized as a patch, not a long-term solution,
-when natural gas burning is seen as a stepping stone, not a final solution,
-when underground power generation (during brief periods of humanity) become paramount to survival

there will be a serious re-evaluation of any and all power sources concerned sentients can conceive.
Funding for prototype testing for new designs will help the energy goals of all.
The road to a fully functional prototype can be long.

All of humanity (and even AI, AGI, ASI, etc.) will need electrical power.
This is a strong reason to work together towards a literally brighter future.

The project details independent research on a potential alternative method to generate electricity.
A long-term goal is for the dimensions detailed in the spreadsheet to be drawn and simulated in CAD,
to help independently verify the math result, using the same dimensions, and build enough confidence in the research to justify a future prototyping phase.
