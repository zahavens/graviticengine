Brainstorm Notes, Math, and Drawings for the Gravitic Engine concept.

This repository contains resources on a theoretical device, currently called Gravitic Engine 7.

The device is designed to generate electricity using high-velocity, circulating liquids around a pump tower,
that contains multiple pump chambers on its inner lower portion. The mechanical advantage of multiple pulley systems allows a small amount of liquid
in raised, alternating counterweights to drive the relatively large plunger heads atop the pump chambers, through a complex series of valve openings and closings.
The mathematical result described in the spreadsheet is surprising. This type of math should result in a conservation of energy, but that is not the case.

So one of two situations is happening:
Either
1) The math is wrong in four different areas:
   a) Force-balance equations related to the pulley system, pump chamber, and counterweights
   b) Energy equations tied to the gravitational potential energy that can be created after one cycle
   c) Energy equations tied to the kinetic energy that can be created by one cycle
   d) Logic checks (over two dozen) to validate the feasibility of the device
   
OR
2) There is an unknown energy source that was left out of the input section of the thermodynamic equation.
The following short list speculates on the device's energy source:
   a) The molecular bonds of the cables within the pulley system (and information related to the weave of the cables or wires)
   b) The gravitational potential energy of the mass underneath the device (extending the system boundary down to include soil shifts due to the spreading vibrations from the operation of the device)
   c) An unknown energy source, possibly related to a fourth dimensional particle (the alleged 'graviton') or more likely some entropic attribute relation to the local rate of the passage of time

The hope is that one day, 
-when nuclear fusion fails to deliver on its promises, (especially within the time tables given by CEOs of nuclear fusion companies),
-when solar panels fail to provide adequate power outside of noon,
-when battery technology is recognized as a patch, not a long-term solution,
-when natural gas burning is seen as a stepping stone, not a final solution,
-when underground power generation (during brief periods of humanity) become paramount to survival

there will be a serious re-evaluation of any and all power sources concerned sentients can conceive.
Funding for prototype testing for new designs will help the energy goals of all.
The road to a fully functional prototype can be long.

All of humanity (and even AI, AGI, ASI, etc.) will need electrical power.
This is a strong reason to work together towards a literally brighter future.

The project details independent research on a potential alternative method to generate electricity.
A long-term goal is for the dimensions detailed in the spreadsheet to be drawn and simulated in CAD,
to help independently verify the math result, using the same dimensions, and build enough confidence in the research to justify a future prototyping phase.
